        <b> <h2> Introduction </h2></b>
        <p> Hi, I'm Mayank Yadav, a passionate and dedicated student pursuing B.tech computer science engineering at Manav Rachna International Institute Of Research and studies. I have a strong interest in web development & cyber security, with a focus on my coding skills & always stay updated about new technology nd developments .</p>
        <p> Throughout my academic journey, I've been actively involved in Modelling societies & cricket club. These experiences have not only enriched my skills, but also provided me with opportunities to collaborate with diverse teams and develop my leadership abilities</p>
        <p>
            I am particularly proud of when I participated in a computer science project in class 12. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge in that project & help me to develop my skills and my interest in a computer science related project. I gained a lot of confidence and knowledge about the coding & computer science project  

        </p>
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I am passionate about Cricket & also like to play golf. I believe in continuous learning and am always seeking new challenges that allow me to grow both personally and professionally
